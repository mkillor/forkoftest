hello world!
This is my newest contributions...
1. First I forked the project to commit to.
2. Cloned it to my IntelliJ
3. Next I created a branch and gave it a feature name
4. I added comments then commit and push to this version/feature
5. Then from github clicked compare and pull request
6. If there are no conflicts than the code can be merged!

More stuff...
7. Then resync the fork from github, and clone it.
8. After the merge delete the branch and start a new branch/feature
9. It is generally a good idea to keep clean workflow this way and commits stay on single branches.
